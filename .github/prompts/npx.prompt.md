Task: Execute the provided npx command in the terminal to add a shadcn/ui component. Check the component for any additional dependencies and install them from shadcn if needed. Then, add the new component to a route named '/componentname' and display it on that route.

Requirements: Use the exact component name from the command. Ensure proper installation and integration into the Next.js app structure.

Constraints: Only install dependencies from shadcn/ui. The route must be created or updated in the app directory (e.g., app/componentname/page.tsx) and render the component correctly.

Success Criteria: Component is installed without errors, all dependencies are resolved, the route is accessible, and the component displays as expected on the page.
