# Gemini Connection Stability Fixes

## Problem Statement

The application was experiencing persistent connection issues where Gemini would connect briefly and then disconnect immediately. This created a poor user experience with the connection being unstable regardless of retries.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Aggressive Health Check Mechanism
- **Issue**: The health check was sending empty text messages (`{ text: "" }`) every 30 seconds to test connection responsiveness
- **Impact**: These empty messages could be rejected by the Gemini API, causing disconnections
- **Additional Issue**: A 10-second timeout on health check responses would trigger reconnection attempts

### 2. Improper Send Method Override
- **Issue**: The `client.send()` method was being overridden in `LiveAPIContext.tsx` to implement usage tracking
- **Impact**: The wrapper didn't properly preserve the method signature and could interfere with message sending
- **Additional Issue**: Message tracking was listening to "content" events (server responses) instead of actual user sends

### 3. Immediate Health Check Start
- **Issue**: Health checks started immediately after connection establishment
- **Impact**: Could interfere with the initial connection setup and handshake process

### 4. Overly Aggressive Reconnection Logic
- **Issue**: The client would attempt to reconnect on any non-1000 close code
- **Impact**: Normal disconnections (going away, intentional closes) would trigger unnecessary reconnection attempts
- **Additional Issue**: Errors during initial connection phase would trigger reconnection loops

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Passive Health Monitoring (genai-live-client.ts)

**Changed from active pinging to passive monitoring:**
```typescript
// Before: Actively sending ping messages
this.session.sendClientContent({
  turns: [{ text: "" }],
  turnComplete: false,
});

// After: Passively monitoring message activity
const timeSinceLastMessage = now - this.lastPingTime;
if (timeSinceLastMessage > this.PING_INTERVAL * 2) {
  // Only validate, don't send messages
  if (!this.validateSession()) {
    this.handleUnresponsiveConnection();
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- No interference with Gemini API's message handling
- Reduced network traffic
- More reliable connection stability detection

### 2. Increased Health Check Intervals

**Adjusted timing parameters:**
- `PING_INTERVAL`: 30s → 60s (less frequent checks)
- `PING_TIMEOUT`: 10s → 15s (more tolerance)
- Added 5-second delay before starting health checks after connection
- Added 10-second grace period before checking newly established connections

**Benefits:**
- Allows connection to fully stabilize before monitoring begins
- Reduces false positives from network latency
- Less aggressive resource usage

### 3. Improved Send Method Override (LiveAPIContext.tsx)

**Fixed the wrapper to properly preserve method signature:**
```typescript
// Before: Incorrect signature and no cleanup
const wrappedSend = (message: any) => {
  // ... checks ...
  return originalSend(message);
};
liveAPI.client.send = wrappedSend as any;

// After: Correct signature with cleanup
const wrappedSend = (parts: any, turnComplete: boolean = true) => {
  // ... checks ...
  return originalSend(parts, turnComplete);
};
client.send = wrappedSend;
return () => {
  client.send = originalSend; // Cleanup on unmount
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Proper method signature preservation
- Correct usage tracking at send time (not on server responses)
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

### 4. Smart Reconnection Logic

**Implemented selective reconnection based on close codes:**
```typescript
// Only reconnect on abnormal closures
const shouldReconnect = 
  e.code === 1006 || // Abnormal closure
  (e.code !== 1000 && e.code !== 1001 && e.code !== 1005);

if (shouldReconnect && this.config && this._model) {
  this.scheduleReconnect();
}
```

**Added connection stability checks before reconnecting:**
```typescript
// Only reconnect if connection was stable
const timeSinceConnection = Date.now() - this.connectionEstablishedTime;
const wasStableConnection = timeSinceConnection > 10000;

if (this._status === "connected" && wasStableConnection) {
  this.scheduleReconnect();
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Avoids reconnection loops on normal disconnections
- Prevents rapid reconnection attempts during initial connection failures
- More intelligent error handling

### 5. Enhanced Session Validation

**Improved passive validation with grace periods:**
```typescript
// Allow up to 3x the ping interval of inactivity
if (timeSinceLastMessage > this.PING_INTERVAL * 3) {
  return false;
}

// New connections are always considered valid
if (timeSinceConnection < 30000) {
  return true;
}
```

**Benefits:**
- More tolerant of legitimate periods of inactivity
- Prevents false negatives during initial connection phase

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
1. **Initial Connection**: Verify connection establishes successfully and remains stable
2. **Idle Period**: Leave connection idle for 2-3 minutes and verify it remains connected
3. **Active Usage**: Send multiple messages and verify responses work correctly
4. **Network Interruption**: Temporarily disable/enable network to test reconnection
5. **Usage Limits**: Test anonymous user message limits trigger correctly
6. **Authentication**: Verify Clerk authentication doesn't interfere with connection

### Monitoring Points
- Check browser console for connection/reconnection logs
- Monitor toast notifications for connection status changes
- Verify no rapid connect/disconnect cycles in logs
- Confirm health check logs show appropriate intervals

## Additional Improvements Made

1. **Better Logging**: Added connection codes and more detailed timing information
2. **Connection Tracking**: Added `connectionEstablishedTime` to track connection stability
3. **Error Categorization**: Different handling for initial vs. stable connection errors
4. **Cleanup Improvements**: Proper cleanup of intervals and timeouts

## Clerk Authentication Considerations

The middleware was already properly configured to not interfere with the Gemini WebSocket connection:
- Clerk middleware only applies to Next.js routes and API endpoints
- Gemini Live API connection is a direct client-to-Google WebSocket
- No changes needed to Clerk configuration

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain backward compatibility:
- Public API of `GenAILiveClient` unchanged
- Event emission patterns preserved
- Method signatures maintained
- Existing usage patterns continue to work

## Performance Impact

**Positive impacts:**
- Reduced network traffic (no more ping messages)
- Less CPU usage (longer intervals)
- Fewer reconnection attempts
- Better resource cleanup

**No negative impacts expected**

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
1. Configurable health check intervals
2. User-facing connection quality indicators
3. Exponential backoff for health check intervals during idle periods
4. Connection metrics collection for analytics
5. WebSocket ping/pong frames (if supported by underlying library)
