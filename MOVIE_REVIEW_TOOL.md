1. **TMDb API Key**: Get one from [TMDb API Settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
2. **Google Gemini API Key**: Get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

### Environment Configuration

Add these variables to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# TMDb API (choose one)
TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_tmdb_v4_access_token_here
# OR
TMDB_API_KEY=your_tmdb_v3_api_key_here

# Google Gemini API
REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### Installation

The tool is integrated into the project:

1. Set up your environment variables
2. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

### API Endpoints (Streamlined)

- `/api/movies/search` - Movie search
- `/api/movies/[id]` - Movie details

### Data Flow

1. User interacts with AI via voice/text
2. AI uses tool functions to query TMDb API
3. Results update the interface automatically
4. User can browse movies and view details

## Code Quality Features

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for API failures
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during data fetching

### Improved Efficiency

- **Faster load times** with streamlined code
- **Better maintainability** with focused functionality
- **Cleaner AI interactions** with simplified tool set

## Customization

### Adding Features

To extend functionality:

1. Add new function declaration in `movie-browser.tsx`
2. Create corresponding API endpoint
3. Handle the tool call in the `onToolCall` function

### Styling

Uses Tailwind CSS for easy customization of:

- Color schemes
