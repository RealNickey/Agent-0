# Session Management Clerk Integration Fix

## Issue
The session API routes were failing with:
```
Error: Clerk: auth() was called but Clerk can't detect usage of clerkMiddleware()
```

## Root Cause
The session API routes (`/api/session/*`) were directly calling Clerk's `auth()` function, which requires the middleware to be properly initialized. Since Agent-0 conditionally uses Clerk middleware (only when `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is set and starts with `pk_`), the `auth()` calls would fail when Clerk wasn't configured.

## Solution
Added a `getSafeUserId()` helper function to all session API routes that:
1. Wraps the `auth()` call in a try-catch block
2. Returns `undefined` for anonymous sessions if Clerk throws an error
3. Allows the session system to work both with and without Clerk authentication

## Files Modified
- `/app/api/session/create/route.ts`
- `/app/api/session/message/route.ts`
- `/app/api/session/[sessionId]/route.ts`
- `/app/api/session/context/route.ts`

## Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Helper function added to each route
async function getSafeUserId(): Promise<string | undefined> {
  try {
    const { userId } = await auth();
    return userId || undefined;
  } catch (error) {
    // Clerk not configured - allow anonymous sessions
    return undefined;
  }
}

// Usage in routes
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const userId = await getSafeUserId(); // ✅ Safe, won't throw
    // ... rest of the route logic
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle other errors
  }
}
```

## Benefits
1. **Backwards Compatible**: Works with or without Clerk
2. **Anonymous Sessions**: Users can use Agent-0 without authentication
3. **Graceful Degradation**: No errors thrown when Clerk is misconfigured
4. **User Isolation**: When Clerk is configured, sessions are still tied to userId

## Testing

### Without Clerk Configuration
```bash
# Remove/comment out Clerk keys in .env.local
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
# CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

npm run dev
# Sessions will work as anonymous
```

### With Clerk Configuration
```bash
# Add valid Clerk keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

npm run dev
# Sessions will be tied to authenticated users
```

## Session Behavior

| Scenario | userId | Session Creation | Access Control |
|----------|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Clerk configured + logged in | `user_abc123` | ✅ User-specific | ✅ User-isolated |
| Clerk configured + not logged in | `undefined` | ✅ Anonymous | ✅ Open access |
| Clerk not configured | `undefined` | ✅ Anonymous | ✅ Open access |

## Important Notes

- Anonymous sessions work perfectly for development and testing
- For production deployments with sensitive data, configure Clerk
- Session data is stored with optional `userId` field
- Authorization checks in routes handle both authenticated and anonymous users

**Status**: ✅ Fixed  
**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Impact**: All session API routes now support both Clerk and anonymous usage
